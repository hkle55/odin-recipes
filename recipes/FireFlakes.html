            Along the lines of popcorn and nachos, flaming fire flakes are
            available in the Fire Nation and its territories at public events
            such as the Fire Days Festival in the Fire Nation Colonial Village (ATLA s.1, ep.16) and 
            entertainment venues like the Ember Island Theater (ATLA s.3, ep.17). 
            As per Fire Nation tastes, these flakes are seasoned with hot spices and served directly after roasting.
