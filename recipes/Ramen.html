        <h3>Step-by-Step instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the tenderloin for at least 3 hours.  You can use just soy sauce, or a mixure of whatever other Asian sauces you want.  Teriyaki would be good, as would some mirin.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to <strong>450</strong>, then cook the tenderloin for 12-15 minutes, or until cooked all the way through.</li>
            <li>Put your eggs in a pot with enough water to cover them.  Bring to a boil and cover with a lid.  It should take about 10 minutes to hard boil the eggs.  
                Then pull them out and put them into a bowl of cold water to cool.</li>
            <li>While this is happening, pour or mix the stock/broth in a pot and bring it to a simmer.  You can add soy sauce or mirin to taste.</li>
            <li>Once simmering, add the Top Ramen noodles.  Do NOT add in the flavor packets.  Let that cook.</li>
            <li>Now, we cut up all the toppings!  Peel the eggs and slice them in half, cut the pork,  kamaboko, bok choy, aburage, and green onion into thin slices.</li>
            <li>Serve up the noodles and broth in a nice deep bowl, then place all the ingredients in groups on top, and add in a few small rectangles of nori.  Itadakimasu!</li>
