            Crispy. Salty. Heaven. Is there anything better than the crunch of freshly fried Homemade Potato Chips?? I'll easily say "no thank you," to ice cream,
            chocolate, or any other sweet. But offer me a potato chip? Yes, please; always yes. And then if you walk away and leave me with that bag/bowl... Well, be warned when you return
            there may not be any chips left
